    <h1>The Modern American Family</h1>
    <h2>Key trends in marriage and family life</h2>
    <h3>By Hayden Whirley</h3>
    <p>In recent decades, the concept of the American family has evolved significantly. There is no longer a single dominant family structure and Americans are experiencing family life in diverse ways.</p>
    <p> From single-parent households to blended families, multi-generational living, and same-sex partnerships, the definition of family has become broader and more inclusive, reflecting the changing societal landscape.</p>
    <p>In 1970, 67% of Americans ages 25 to 49 were living with their spouse and one or more children younger than 18. Over the past five decades that share has dropped to 37%.</p>

<p>Americans are marrying later in life, and a rising share have never been married.</p>

<p>Changes in fertility patterns have also had a significant impact on family dynamics. Women today have fewer children compared to the 1970s.</p>
<p>The average number of lifetime births per woman ages 40-44 has decreased from 3 children in 1980 to 2 children in 2020.</p>
<p>The relationship between marriage and parenthood has also shifted, as more women are having children without being married. American couples are cohabiting with kids, unpartnered with kids, married with no kids, or cohabiting with no kids.</p>
<p>The % of children younger than 18 who are living with two married parents was 82% in 1970, decreasing to 64% in 2021.</p>
<p>These changes help explain why married couples raising children together is no longer the norm.</p>
